# factory-game
A game about optimizing a grid-based factory... I might still go many ways with this game, but we'll see. I'll try to hold a sort-of devlog of how I'm thinking of each thing next on the todo list. In the end though, we'll see how well that goes

Already forgot to do this for a couple commits, but that... will surely be fine. 
(I just added some parameters I think will be useful for this, might end up adding some, deleting some, we'll see')

At the moment, I'm looking to do the functions inside sim_tick, starting with move_tokens. 
I'll likely end up using loops for them, basically checking how far each individual token has to move, 
then moving it. Btw I hope these "devlogs" (no idea what else to call them) will help with reviewing.
